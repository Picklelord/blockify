# blockify

This app was created to eliminate hearing ad's in Spotify.
It mutes your computer while ad's are playing.
The only requirement is that spotify is already open when you run the tool.
Enjoy!


Known issues that may be addressed in the future:
 - if crossfeed is on, there will be a short half second-ish end of the ad played
 - if you close and reopen Spotify, sometimes it does not get picked up
 - on pausing spotify, it mutes the pc
 - on rare occasions the mute can flip, if this happens you need to click the mute button in this tool to flip it without affacting the playing
